## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to position background images, and I learned how to create layouts using CSS Grid.

### Continued development

I've only just started working with CSS Grid, so that is something I plan on learning in more detail. So I can make better use of it. In addition, I want to try and continue working with a mobile-first workflow.
